    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This is a hackathon project! It is very hard to get information about what it's like to co-op at a company.</p>
    <p>The best methods we have right now are finding people through Facebook groups who have co-oped at a company, or reading Glassdoor reviews.</p>
    <p>However, Glassdoor reviews may not really be indicitive of what the actual experience at a company is like, their processes could be old, they could be from teams you wouldn't be working on, or the company could be so big that you don't have good information about the role being reviewed. Additionally, it can be hard to get specific data that you want.</p>
    <p>With this project, we want to make it possible to rate the interview experience for co-ops and the actual co-op experience.</p>
